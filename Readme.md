### Binary Trees

Module of **System engineering** and **Devops**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0-binary_tree_node.c`]
-Write a function that creates a binary tree node
-Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
--Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
-And value is the value to put in the new node
-When created, a node does not have any child
-Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure |
| [`1-binary_tree_insert_left.c`]
-Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
-Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
-Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
-And value is the value to store in the new node
-Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
-If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node. |
| [`2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`]
# Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

-Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
-Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
-And value is the value to store in the new node
-Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
-If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.* |
| [`3-binary_tree_delete.c`]
# Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

-Prototype: void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);
-Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
-if tree is NULL, do nothing |
